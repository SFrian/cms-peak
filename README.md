CMSeeK Results Merger

This repository contains CMSeeK scan results and a Python script to merge all cms.json files into a single JSON file for easier analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

ðŸ“‚ cmseek-results
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Result/              # CMSeeK scan results (each target has its own folder)
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ merge_cmseek_results.py  # Script to merge JSON results
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ .gitignore           # Ignore unnecessary files
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ README.md            # Documentation
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ merged_results.json  # Final merged result (after running script)

ðŸš€ How to Use

Run the Python script to merge results:

python merge_cmseek_results.py

This will generate merged_results.json, which contains all scan results in one file.

Upload the results to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Updated scan results"
git push origin main

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Make sure all CMSeeK scan results are inside the Result/ folder before running the script.

merged_results.json will be overwritten each time you run the script.
